I am a Ph.D. Candidate at Purdue University, West Lafayette. I am a Graduate Research Assistant and the Lab Manager of the [Collaborative Robotics Lab](https://www.purdue.edu/crl/){:target=_"_blank"} where I am advised by [Prof. Richard Voyles](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~rvoyles/){:target="_blank"}.

Bringing meaningful betterment to the world is my goal. Leveraging technology I aim to address problems contributing to food security, climate change, and animal welfare. My thesis focuses on designing Cyber Physical Systems with robotic edges for Precision Animal Agriculture addressing productivity, animal welfare, and impact of farm activites on the environment. As a research intern at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/){:target="_blank"} in the [Research for Industry](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/research-for-industry/){:target="_blank"} team addresses the problem of traceability in agricultural supply chains. My CV is availble here.
