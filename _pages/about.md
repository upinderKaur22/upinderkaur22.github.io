I am an Assistant Professor at Purdue University in the Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering (ABE). I earned my Ph.D. in Technology from Purdue University, West Lafayette, where I conducted research in the <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/crl/"><b>Collaborative Robotics Lab</b></a> under the guidance of <a href="https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~rvoyles/"><b>Prof. Richard Voyles</b></a>.

My work reimagines cyber-physical systems (CPS) with robots as the mobile and dextrous edge, realizing a richer reactive interface between the physical and the cyber world. Within a cyber-physical systems paradigm, resource-aware robots can overcome the many challenges of operating in austere environments. In my thesis, I developed a novel architecture of CPS with robots for precision animal agriculture to bring the emphasis back on caring for individuals while improving welfare and productivity. As a part of this work,<a href="https://upinderkaur22.github.io/projects/1_project/"><b>I deployed robots in cows!</b></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
Looking ahead, my ambitions are centered around crafting impactful systems that involve robots addressing critical aspects such as locomotion, localization, communication, networking, and security. These endeavors extend to real-world applications in fields, oceans, and even extraterrestrial exploration, ushering in a new era of technological innovation.</p>
