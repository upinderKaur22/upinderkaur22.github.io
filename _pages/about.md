I am a Ph.D. Candidate at Purdue University, West Lafayette. I am a Graduate Research Assistant and the Lab Manager of the [Collaborative Robotics Lab](https://www.purdue.edu/crl/){:target=_"_blank"} where I am advised by [Prof. Richard Voyles](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~rvoyles/){:target="_blank"}.

Bringing meaningful betterment to the world is my goal. I aim to develop technology to address global problems such as food security, animal welfare, and climate change. My thesis focuses on designing Cyber Physical Systems with robotic edges for Precision Animal Agriculture addressing productivity, animal welfare, and impact of farm activites on the environment.
