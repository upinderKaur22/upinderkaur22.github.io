Bringing meaningful betterment to the world is my goal. Leveraging technology, I aim to address problems contributing to food security, climate change, and animal welfare. My thesis focuses on designing Cyber Physical Systems with robotic edges for Precision Animal Agriculture to improve productivity and animal welfare while reducing the impact of farm activites on the environment. As a research intern at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/){:target="_blank"} in the [Research for Industry](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/research-for-industry/){:target="_blank"} team, I designed systems for imporving traceability in agricultural supply chains. My full [CV is availble here]. </p>
