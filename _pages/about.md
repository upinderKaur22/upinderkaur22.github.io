I am a Ph.D. Candidate at Purdue University, West Lafayette. I am the Lab Manager and Graduate Research Assistant at the <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/crl/"> <b>Collaborative Robotics Lab</b></a> where I am advised by <a href="https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~rvoyles/"><b>Prof. Richard Voyles</b></a>.</p>

  
<p style="text-align:justify"> 
My work reimagines cyber-physical systems (CPS) with robots as the mobile and dextrous edge, realizing a richer reactive interface between the physical and the cyber world. In my thesis, I use this novel architecture of CPS with robots for precision animal agriculture to bring the emphasis back on caring for individuals while improving welfare and productivity. As a part of this work,<a href="https://upinderkaur22.github.io/projects/1_project/"><b>I deployed robots in cows!</b></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify">          
At <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/"><b>Microsoft Research</b></a>, in the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/research-for-industry/"><b>Research for Industry</b></a> team, I developed a novel generalizable tracking system with connected tiny nodes that embeds trusted traceability into agricultural supply chains without major infrastructure demands. I am passionate about real-world impact, especially in the areas of agriculture, sustainability, climate change, and welfare.</p>
