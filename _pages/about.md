My work reimagines agricultural systems to bring the emphasis back on caring for individuals, thereby helping solve the grand challenges of food security and sustainability. My Ph.D. thesis focuses on designing Cyber-Physical Systems with robot edges for Precision Animal Agriculture to improve animal welfare and sustainability of the operations. Simply put, <a href="https://upinderkaur22.github.io/projects/1_project/"><b>I deploy robots in cows!</b></a></p>
