Feeding a global population of 10 Billion by 2050 is a major challenge facing humanity! As nations get welthier and urbanized, the consumption of animal-derived products, such as meat and dairy, increases. In the face of decreasing land and water availability as well increasing concern for ethical treatment of animals, boosting productivity and sustainability of agriculture is a the problem I undertake in this work. 

Research indicates that boosting animal welfare can increase the productivity of current livetsock operations. Precision animal agriculture or precision livestock farming (PLF), as a movement, encourages returning to the "per animal approach", wherein care is customized acording to the needs of individuals rather than aggregates taken for the whole herd. Since commercial farms today have more than 10,000 animals, it is impossible to care for individuals manually. Therefore, we build technological solutions to address the needs and concerns of animal agriculture, in general, and dairy farming, in particular.

Cyber physical systems have proven their mettle in crop agriculture by delivering increased productivity, real-time care, and optimized use of resources. However, animal agriculture is a much greater challenge. Each individual is a valuable, sentient being with autonomy of movement and behvior unlike crops. While it takes weeks to months for chnages to precipitate in crops, animal heath can change in a matter of hours. Animals not only have individuality but are social beings too. Therefore, the dynamics of the herd plays a major role in their overall wellbeing.

Addresing these challenges we built the closed-loop cyber-physical system for precision animal agriculture, with an emphasis on dairy farming. 

The initial step in building the network was characterizing the communication from inside the body of the animal to the outside. We conducted the seminal study for identifying the optimal freqeuncy for RF-based wireless communication. The setup is shown in the figure below.
