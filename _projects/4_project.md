Enabling each robot to secure itself against malicious software.The unique framework allows edge-level intelligence using scaled machine-learning models to ensure security. The first step in this endeavour was to create the first-of-its-kind dataset for malware and good software for robots, <a href="https://purr.purdue.edu/publications/3860/1">The RoboMal Dataset</a>.

Adversarial defense builds robustness into these models, while zero-shot learning allows such models to mature with time to learn previously unseen classes of malware. The overview of this thrust is available at <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9797557">ICCPS2022</a>.
